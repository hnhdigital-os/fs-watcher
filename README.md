### watch:now or watch:background

For example, if we want to watch for changes in the `/some/folder/example` path and have all changes notified to the executable file `/some/bin/binary-file`.

Note: This utility replaces the following placeholders {{root-path}}, {{file-path}} and {{event-id}} in the script-arguments argument with values. Both path arguments do not need quotations as they will be added automatically.

`fs-watcher watch:background /some/folder/example /some/bin/binary-file --script-arguments="{{root-path}} {{file-path}} {{event-id}}"`

On each file change in the given root folder, the following command execution will occur:

`/some/bin/binary-file "/some/folder/example" "/some/folder/example/new-file" 256`

### watch:load

Instead of calling this utility for each folder you want to watch, you can use the `watch:load` command to load a YAML config file.

This config file is in the format:

```yml
WATCH-PATH:
 - BINARY-PATH: SCRIPT-ARGUMENTS
```

Example:

```yml
/some/folder/example:
 - /some/bin/binary-file: {{root-path}} {{file-path}} {{event-id}}
```

And then run this to load and start the watcher:

```
fs-watcher watch:load example.yml
```
